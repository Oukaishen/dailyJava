## Maven

Dependency management tools. 

> There is not much difficulty in managing dependencies for a single project, but when you start getting into dealing with multi-module projects and applications that consist of tens or hundreds of modules this is where Maven can help you a great deal in maintaining a high degree of control and stability.

<br>

>  *Dependency scope*Â - this allows you to only include dependencies appropriate for the current stage of the build.
